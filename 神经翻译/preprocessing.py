This file pre-process source data set.
Firstly, read training data set, numbering the word in training set for source language and target language in a dict.
Secondly, convert the sentence to num sequence according to the dict generated before.
Thirdly, read testing and developing data set, convert the sentence to num sequence according to the dict.
Finally, write relevant information in txt file.
**********
What you should focus on is that I padding '<BOS>' and '<EOS>' at the beginning and ending of the sentence respectively.
If the word in testing or developing data set is a new word, I replacing it by 'UKN'.
What's more, there is a word '<PAD>' in my dict, means to padding if the sentences in a batch have different length in a batch.
Word segmentation tool is jieba.
